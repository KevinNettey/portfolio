title: 'High Voltage Power Stage Project'
description: 'The High Voltage Power Stage Project was done within the Miami University Power Electronics Laboratory, and was a small part of a larger project. The top level project features the designing of a bi-directional charging system that is powered by a solar panel and charges a 48 V battery and powers home appliances simultaneously with a 5 kW output. For this project, I made over 15 different 3D models, some of which can be seen below. The models varied greatly in complexity, and all of these parts serve one purpose or another in the very complex final assembly.'

## Smaller Models

**Busbars, Varistors and Transformers**: These are a few simple models that were used in larger assemblies that display my skill in working on smaller parts.

## Larger Models

**High Voltage Power Stage PCB and Heatsink Assembly**: This is the culmination of my work in this project. It involves multiple smaller assemblies that I put together, as well as models that I made from scratch.
