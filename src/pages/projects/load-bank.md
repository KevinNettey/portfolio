title: 'Load Bank Project'
description: 'The Load Bank Project was a small part of a larger project done within the Miami University Power Electronics Laboratory. For this project, I constructed a 4-kilowatt, 7.8 ohm load bank from scratch using multiple sets of resistors. The project was my introduction to working with hardware, and I made use of both manual and powered tools in the mechanical engineering machine shop. I also learned important skills like crimping and soldering wires, mounting resistors on heatsinks and joining various materials via screws or nails. Beyond these, I also developed my soft skills. The limited space and materials allowed me to build on my planning skills to avoid waste, and the weekly check-ins with my supervisor helped me further develop my communication skills.'

## Smaller Models

**Busbars, Varistors and Transformers**: These are a few simple models that were used in larger assemblies that display my skill in working on smaller parts.

## Larger Models

**High Voltage Power Stage PCB and Heatsink Assembly**: This is the culmination of my work in this project. It involves multiple smaller assemblies that I put together, as well as models that I made from scratch.
